            &nbsp; Education Secretary Margaret Spellings said the department was temporarily
            suspending access to its National Student Loan Data System--a database of information
            on 60 million student borrowers at more than 20,000 schools--by lenders, loan holders,
            and servicers, and guaranty agencies. The federal agency's concern: Some of the
            7,500 loan company employees with access to the system were mining information to
            market products and services to borrowers and their families. </span>

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="color: #003366">Spellings signaled the move in an open letter to Sen. Edward
                Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee,
                who had sent her a letter earlier in the week urging the shutoff. "Lenders are apparently
                using this information to aggressively market to students," Kennedy wrote, prompted
                by his committee's investigation of the student loan industry and several published
                reports. "The </span><a>
                    <span style="color: #003366">privacy</span></a><span style="color: #003366"> of every
                        borrower must be a top priority for the department." </span>
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="color: #003366">While access to the database is suspended, the department
                and its Office of Inspector General will review how the database is being used--or
                misused--by loan companies and whether it needs to cut off access permanently to
                certain companies. Loan borrowers and university officials continue to have access
                during the review period. </span>
